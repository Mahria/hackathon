## Vision ##
To create a simple, text-light and visually friendly responsive website to help end users with a wide range of home language skills and literacy levels access IRCO's vast network of services. We were driven by a desire to connect people to the most revelant information for them in the simplest way possible. 

### Features we would build out if given more time ###
* Customized resources provided based on user's family SUN school and/or intersts
* Filtering IRCO associated sites on map based on interests selected
* Text translated based on langauge selected on landing page
